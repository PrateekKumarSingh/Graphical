# Installation

### [PowerShell v5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50395) and Later
You can install the `Graphical` module directly from the PowerShell Gallery


* **[Recommended]** Install to your personal PowerShell Modules folder
    ```PowerShell
    Install-Module Graphical -scope CurrentUser
    ```
* **[Requires Elevation]** Install for Everyone (computer PowerShell Modules folder)
    ```PowerShell

    ```

### PowerShell v4 and Earlier

```PowerShell
iex (new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrateekKumarSingh/Graphical/master/Install.ps1')
```

# Features
* Color-coded output depending upon the Value of data point
* Colors codes can be customized by passing a color-map hash table
* Custom X an Y-Axis labels
* Graph in console is independent and fully customizable, not like Task Manager (Performance Tab)
* Could be incorporated in Powershell scripts
* Can consume data points generated during script run or Pre stored data like in a file or database.
* Independent of PowerShell version, and Works on PowerShell Core (Windows\Linux)

# Use Cases
1. The function `Show-Graph` takes data points as input and plot them on a 2D graph

    The function `Show-Graph` can consume data points, generated during script execution or from a file or database like in the above example.

2. Plotting Audio Peak Levels in your PowerShell Console (Don't forget to play some audio! :P)

    ```PowerShell
    Install-Module AudioDeviceCmdlets, Graphical
    Import-Module AudioDeviceCmdlets, Graphical -Verbose
    $Device = Get-AudioDevice -Playback
    [int[]]$datapoints =@(0)*50
    do {
        $PeakValue = $Device.Device.AudioMeterInformation.MasterPeakValue*100
        $datapoints += [int]$PeakValue
        $datapoints = $datapoints | Select-Object -last 50
        Clear-Host
        Show-Graph -datapoints $datapoints -GraphTitle AudioLevels
        Show-Graph -datapoints $datapoints -GraphTitle AudioLevels -Type Line
        Show-Graph -datapoints $datapoints -GraphTitle AudioLevels -Type Scatter
        Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 1000

3. Visualizing Azure Monitor Metrics like CPU %age on a Virtual machine in #PowerShell

    ```PowerShell
    $ResourceID = '/subscriptions/<subscription>/resourceGroups/demo-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/SimpleWinVM'
    $Data = Get-AzMetric -ResourceId $ResourceID  -WarningAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object unit, data
    $Datpoints = $data.data.average.foreach({[int]$_})

    Import-Module Graphical
    Show-Graph -Datapoints $Datpoints -GraphTitle 'CPU (% age)'
    ```
